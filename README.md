# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to the problems in the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), solving problems every day of December until Christmas (Day 25).

I will be using 5 languages:  
- Python
- Java
- C#
- C++
- JavaScript

Each will be used to solve 5 days of puzzles throughout the month.

*Day 01 - 05* will use **Python**<br>
*Day 06 - 10* will use **JavaScript**<br>
*Day 11 - 15* will use **Java**<br>
*Day 16 - 20* will use **C++**<br>
*Day 21 - 25* will use **C#**<br>

I am intentionally reserving later, harder puzzles for languages that I would like to be challenged with, for practice.
